# firebase-react-redux-babel-boilerplate

### Operation: M.O.U.T.H.F.U.L.L
A general use boilerplate for all tags listed in the name. I use it for most of the websites I create for businesses because of the resuable components and comprehensive boilerplate for most types of businesses. After I determine what I need for the customer I *trim the fat* and have a finished product as quick as possible to save myself time and themselves **money**.

#### Thanks To These Libraries

- Firebase
    1. Its fast queries and simple integration with firestore make it a good choice for most small businesses, but is still quite scalable if their needs grow.
    2. Firebase Hosting is fast!
    3. Firebase Storage obviously works well with the above
- React
    1. Great Front End Framework.
    2. React is Love, React is Life.
    3. Allows myself to make sites in an accelerated time frame with semi-complex to complex-ui.
    4. Shadow Dom
- Redux
    1. Becase firestore is in the picture react could be avoided but because it is such a small package and seperates global and local data so well I use it
- Babel
    1. Good Compiler for backwards compatiblity
    2. Polyfill
    3. React preset
- Ill add the rest later...
